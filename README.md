# Ares Matchmaking (MySQL)

A real-time 5v5 matchmaking backend: FastAPI, MySQL (aiomysql) and
WebSockets, with Elo-based team balancing, party support and live
MATCH_FOUND notifications.

This is a readability-focused refactor of
[AayushK29/ares_engine](https://github.com/AayushK29/ares_engine)
(original authors: Aayush Kanade, Mahesh Thakur, Ankur Raj), reorganized
into modules with the SQL isolated in one data-access layer, the
matchmaking logic made pure and unit-testable, and a real test suite added.
A PostgreSQL port of the same codebase lives at
[instinctsetup/ares-matchmaking-postgres](https://github.com/instinctsetup/ares-matchmaking-postgres).

## What it does

- Parties of 1-5 players join a region queue (`POST /join`)
- A background engine sweeps the queue every few seconds, packs parties
  into two exact 5-player teams (subset-sum over party sizes) and creates a
  match when the teams' average Elos are within a threshold
- The threshold relaxes the longer the oldest player waits; after 60s the
  sweep goes cross-region (GLOBAL)
- Every party in a match gets a MATCH_FOUND push over its WebSocket
  (`/ws/{party_id}`)
- Heartbeats keep queue entries alive; a reaper purges stale ones
- Match resolution (`POST /match/{id}/resolve`) records the winner and
  applies Elo stakes (+25 / -20)
- Reporting: `/queue`, `/matches`, `/leaderboard`, `/stats`,
  `/analytics/throughput`
- A zero-build demo web UI served by the app itself at `/ui`
  (`frontend/` - plain HTML/CSS/JS): party builder, one-click 10-player
  demo, live queue, MATCH_FOUND pop-up over WebSocket, match resolution,
  leaderboard, stats and throughput charts

## Project layout

```
ares/
  config.py        all tunables and the DATABASE_URL
  models.py        Pydantic request models
  database.py      every SQL statement (aiomysql data-access layer)
  matchmaking.py   pure logic: party grouping, team packing, Elo math
  engine.py        background loops: matchmaker + heartbeat reaper
  websocket.py     per-party WebSocket registry
  main.py          FastAPI app, routes, lifespan
tests/
  test_matchmaking_logic.py   pure unit tests, no database
  test_api.py                 end-to-end tests against a scratch database
  test_frontend.py            the demo UI is served at /ui
frontend/
  index.html, style.css, app.js   demo UI (static files, no build step)
scripts/
  stress_test.py   queue load injector
```

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE ares_db;"
export MYSQL_HOST=localhost MYSQL_PORT=3306 MYSQL_USER=ares_user \
       MYSQL_PASSWORD=ares_password MYSQL_DB=ares_db
# or, over a local socket: export MYSQL_SOCKET=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
uvicorn ares.main:app --reload
```

Then open the demo UI at <http://localhost:8000/ui> - build a party and
join the queue, or hit **Quick demo** to auto-fill a 10-player match and
watch MATCH_FOUND arrive live over the WebSocket.

The app (re)creates its schema on startup - point it at a scratch database,
not a production one. Optional load test:

```bash
python scripts/stress_test.py            # injects 50 random parties
```

## Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
export MYSQL_HOST=localhost MYSQL_USER=root MYSQL_DB=ares_test   # scratch DB
pytest
```

17 tests: pure matchmaking-logic units, end-to-end API tests that join
10 players, watch a real match form, resolve it and check Elo changes,
and static-serving tests for the demo UI.
The suite is synchronous (starlette TestClient); pytest.ini disables
pytest-asyncio, which interferes with TestClient teardown if installed.

## Behaviour changes vs the original

Only one deliberate fix: rejoining the queue now also updates the player's
`party_id` (the original kept the stale party id). Everything else is a
reorganization: same endpoints, same algorithm, same thresholds - plus a
committed-`__pycache__` cleanup and the missing `requirements.txt`.
Known original quirks kept as-is: a GLOBAL match is still recorded under
the region whose sweep created it.
